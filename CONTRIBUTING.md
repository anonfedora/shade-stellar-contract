## Development Setup

### Prerequisites

- Rust (stable toolchain)
- Cargo
- Soroban CLI (if needed for contract deployment)

### Building the Project

```bash
# Build all contracts
cargo build --workspace --release

# Build a specific contract
cargo build --manifest-path contracts/shade/Cargo.toml --release
```

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
cargo test --workspace --all-features

# Run tests for a specific contract
cargo test --manifest-path contracts/shade/Cargo.toml
```

### Code Formatting

```bash
# Format all code
cargo fmt --all

# Check formatting
cargo fmt --all -- --check
```

### Linting

```bash
# Run clippy
cargo clippy --workspace --all-features -- -D warnings
```

## Pre-commit Hooks

This project uses pre-commit hooks to ensure code quality. Install and set them up:

```bash
# Install pre-commit (requires Python)
pip install pre-commit

# Install the hooks
pre-commit install

# Run hooks manually
pre-commit run --all-files
```

The hooks will automatically:
- Validate YAML files
- Format Rust code
- Run clippy checks
- Check for merge conflicts

## Commit Guidelines

### Commit Message Format

We follow conventional commit format:

```
<type>(<scope>): <subject>

<body>

<footer>
```

### Types

- `feat`: A new feature
- `fix`: A bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation only changes
- `style`: Code style changes (formatting, missing semicolons, etc.)
- `refactor`: Code refactoring
- `test`: Adding or updating tests
- `chore`: Maintenance tasks

### Examples

```
feat(contract): add new token transfer function
